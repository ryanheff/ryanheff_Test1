For my project, I plan to analyze public data sets about security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the data set will either be from the National Vulnerability Database or from the VERIS Community Database. My choice between these two data sets will depend upon which looks more interesting once I have done some preliminary analysis on them. 

In my analysis, I’ll be looking to determine what lessons can be learned to improve cyber security, which is the field I work in. As a defender of cloud services, we often struggle to determine where we should concentrate our limited defense resources. For example, one thing I’ll be interested to learn is what vulnerability characteristics most closely correlate with which vulnerabilities actually get exploited by attackers.
